# Why didn't you just...

## Use a json schema validator

Most json schema validators do not validate YAML against json schemas.

## Generate go objects from the swagger spec using go-swagger

I did try this but then realized go can't do dynamic object lookup and only loads objects that are directly referenced.

## Write it in python

I did but then deleted it because I am not a good python programmer.
