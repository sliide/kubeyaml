// ClusterPhase is a string representation of a Cluster Phase.
//
// This type is a high-level indicator of the status of the Cluster as it is provisioned,
// from the API user’s perspective.
//
// The value should not be interpreted by any software components as a reliable indication
// of the actual state of the Cluster, and controllers should not use the Cluster Phase field
// value when making decisions about what action to take.
//
// Controllers should always look at the actual state of the Cluster’s fields to make those decisions.
